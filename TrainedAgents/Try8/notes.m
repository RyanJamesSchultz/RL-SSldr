% I'm getting closer to straighforward learning.  This mostly seems to
% have been a function of slowing down learning rates and noise decay
% rates.  Said another way, exploring longer and learning more slowly.  
% This avoids acting on catastrophic choices, by sampling bad examples 
% better and not changing to poor actors as quickly.  Still ended up being 
% a problem eventually though.
