%%% Notes to myself and future readers about lessons learned.
% Try 1 (12 June 2023).

% This was a first attempt at doing an end-to-end learning.  The agent has
% sucessfully learned how to do Step 1 (triggering nucleation), but it
% struggles to do this precisely enough to give room to start Step 2.  This
% is even after millions of training examples.

% My apologies, I didn't think to include the script_DDPG.m file 
% (or even these notes) when I first started working on this project.  Some 
% of the parameters set can be found by looking at the agent class, within 
% the *.mat files.
