% Try 15 (4 Sept 2023).

% Let's try this again.  This time I'm being a little a tiny bit more 
% conservative with how I decrease the noise plateaus - otherwise, 
% everything else is the same as Try 13.  This idea is based on the 
% observation that I was able to get past Try13's p2 crash before when 
% using Matlab's noise resetting bug/feature.
% 
% Using a p2 noise plateau of 0.03 doesn't seem to have fixed that issue.
% I need to think more seriously about stabilizing the learning process,
% apparently.
